# Browser Fingerprinting
Update: The site is accessible here --> https://daniel-f-morine.github.io/BrowserFingerprinting/

This is a repo for a site that explains browser fingerprinting, but I switched out the PHP for pure JS since to reduce hosting costs. The concept of browser fingerprinting is an interesting, surprisingly simple concept, but in my opinion, not very well taught.  It is a fundamental aspect of internet privacy, and as such, I made my first ever website explaining the concept to the best of my non-expert understanding, and explained how you can use the TOR browser to mitigate fingerprinting.
