# Browser Fingerprinting
2024 Update: The site is now only accessible here --> https://daniel-f-morine.github.io/BrowserFingerprinting/

This is a repo for a site that explains browser fingerprinting, but I don't use server side languages since I can't afford dynamic hosting.
The concept of browser fingerprinting is surprisingly simple, but in my opinion, not very well taught.  It is a
fundamental aspect of internet privacy, and as such, I made my first ever website explaining the concept to the
best of my non-expert understanding, and explained how you can use the TOR browser to mitigate fingerprinting.
